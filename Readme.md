# 🚀 Task 2 – Startup Pitch Deck Evaluation with NLP (ScaleDux AI Internship)

Hey! I'm **Sushant Yadav**, and this is my submission for Task 2 of the ScaleDux AI Internship.  
The goal was to evaluate multiple startup pitch decks using basic NLP techniques — just like an investor would, but automated with code. 🤖💼

## 🧠 What I Did

I worked with 5 real startup pitch decks (Airbnb, Uber, Facebook, etc.) and built a Python-based system that:

- 📄 Extracts text from each deck (PDF format)
- 📌 Identifies key topics like Problem, Market, Traction, Team, etc.
- ✅ Scores each deck using a rule-based NLP approach (based on keyword matches)
- 📊 Ranks the startups and visualizes the results with a bar chart

This project gave me a great opportunity to mix NLP with real-world decision making!
